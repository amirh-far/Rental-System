## About

This project has an emphasis on using SQL Queries to master main and key queries.<br>
To interact with the user, I used Python. So user can enter his/her commands via Terminal.<br>
The database used in this project is Sakila Database which is documented at this [link](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/).<br>
